# MoodDiaryApp

Do you want to **track your mood** for a distance? <br>
Meet **Mood Diary!** :book:

Actually it doesn't do much like it's older brothers.
But it perfectly illustrates **skills and technologies I posses.**

## In details:
1. MVVM + Room + ViewModel;
2. ViewPager2 + FragmentStateAdapter;
3. DataBinding;
4. Fragments;
5. LiveData;
6. Channels;
7. Dependency injection with Hilt;
8. SharedPreferences.

**Great!** You've reached the most interesting part - pictures! <br>
And of course, complications I faced on my way. :dizzy_face:

## What it does?
